# SlicerCART Purpose

This section explains the rationale behind SlicerCART and its purpose.


**Rationale:**

* Manual segmentation and classification tasks are required in the research setting related to medical imaging artificial intelligence tool development
* An open-source solution for such tasks would better benefit the research setting
* Actual open-source solutions that enable imaging viewing and annotation are not optimal from an end-user standpoint (especially from various background), increasing the already high burden of manual segmentation and classification tasks
* A workflow aimed to efficiently navigate through a dataset while performing manual segmentation / correction, including revision steps and robust annotation consistency assessment is crucial for handling large amount of data and provide the best ground-truth references segmentation as possible.
